        ### Welcome to the Graph Generation App

        This app creates **dynamic supply chain graphs** using advanced **random generation techniques**. Hereâ€™s how the process works:

        #### Node Creation and Structure
        - We start with a **base of 26 nodes**, including one **Business Group**, multiple **Product Families**, and their associated **Product Offerings**.
        - From there,we can add how many ever nodes we want based on our requirement by entering into the **user input** placeholder.

        #### Randomized Node and Link Generation
        Our unique graph generation process employs **two key randomization steps**:

        1. **Density Factor Influence**:
           - Each **Product Offering** is assigned a **Density Factor** (a value between 0 and 1) that determines the likelihood of forming a **link**. A higher density factor means more connections, while a lower density factor limits links.
           - This first randomization ensures that the structure of the graph is unique and adaptive to each node.

        2. **Poisson/Normal Distribution**:
           - Once the possibility of a link is determined, the number of **Modules** and **Parts** linked to each **Product Offering** is calculated using **Poisson** or **Normal distribution**. This adds an element of **natural randomness** in the number of nodes generated, mimicking real-world supply chain dynamics.
           - The **Density Factor** also governs the number of connections added. High-density offerings receive more links, while low-density offerings generate fewer.

        Through this process, the graph grows organically, reflecting realistic and varied supply chain relationships. ðŸŽ¯
